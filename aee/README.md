This module contains the core technical components of the AEE Protocol.



It is responsible for the computation and handling of cryptographic hashes,

basic metadata association, and internal data structures used by the system.

\## Scope



The `aee` module focuses exclusively on technical operations, including:



\- SHA-256 hash computation

\- Handling of input data

\- Internal representation of preserved records

\- Support functions used by higher-level interfaces



This module does not perform any legal, semantic, or contextual interpretation

of the data it processes.

\## Design principles



\- Deterministic behavior

\- Reproducibility of results

\- Minimal external dependencies

\- Clear separation between technical logic and presentation layers



---



\## Intended audience



This documentation is intended for developers, auditors, and contributors

interested in understanding or extending the internal technical behavior

of the system.
